1. 
	the nm show the two functions that the flag is different.
	the first average function is averagePdRd, which means the two parameters are pointer and reference.
	the second average function is averageif, which means the parameters are integer and float.
2.
	the size of different variable type is different.
	char: 1 byte
	int: 4 byte
	float: 4 byte
	double: 8 byte
	however, the pointer of different type is the same, because the pointer is declare the memory. 
	Therefore, the magnitude of pointer is depend on the computer which is 32 bits or 64 bits.
